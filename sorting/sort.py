# Sort Algorithms:
# 1. Bubble Sort
#  - Pseudocode:
#    - Loop through the list
#    - Compare the current element with the next element
#    - If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them
#    - Continue until the end of the list
#    - Repeat the process until the list is sorted


# 2. Selection Sort
#  - Pseudocode:
#    - Loop through the list
#    - Find the smallest element in the list
#    - Swap the smallest element with the first element
#    - Continue until the list is sorted


# 3. Insertion Sort
#  - Pseudocode:
#    - Loop through the list
#    - Find the index of the current element
#    - Loop through the list from the beginning to the current index
#    - If the current element is smaller than the element at the current index, swap them
#    - Continue until the current element is greater than the element at the current index


# 4. Merge Sort
#  - Pseudocode:
#    - Divide the list into two halves
#    - Sort the two halves
#    - Merge the two sorted halves


# 5. Quick Sort
#  - Pseudocode:
#    - Pick a pivot element
#    - Partition the list into two halves
#    - Sort the two halves


# 6. Heap Sort
#  - Pseudocode:
#    - Build a max heap
#    - Swap the first element with the last element
#    - Remove the last element
#    - Repeat until the list is sorted
